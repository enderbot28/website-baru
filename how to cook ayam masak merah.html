	  Baked Salmon with Roasted Vegetables

      Ingredients:

      4 salmon fillets
      1 lb of mixed vegetables (such as broccoli, carrots, and bell peppers)
      2 tbsp of olive oil
      1 tbsp of garlic powder
      1 tbsp of dried oregano
      Salt and pepper to taste
Instructions:

Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).

Cut the vegetables into bite-sized pieces and toss them with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, garlic powder, oregano, salt, and pepper.

Arrange the vegetables on a baking sheet and roast them in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until tender and slightly caramelized.

While the vegetables are roasting, season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper.

Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the salmon fillets, skin-side down, and cook for 3-4 minutes until the skin is crispy.

Flip the salmon fillets over and cook for another 2-3 minutes until the salmon is cooked through.

Serve the salmon fillets with the roasted vegetables on the side.

Enjoy your delicious and healthy dinner!
